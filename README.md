# Nil-Clean Matrices
An element a of an associative ring is called a nil-clean element if it is the sum of an idempotent e and a nilpotent q. The least index of nilpotence of q satisfying this property is called the nil-clean index of a.
This repository contains programs for finding nil-clean elements of nil-clean index k in the full matrix ring M_n(F_2), for certain k. The most interesting are cases k = 3 and k = 4. See my math paper [Å ter, On expressing matrices over Z_2 as the sum of an idempotent and a nilpotent, Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 2018] for more information.

## Nil-clean.pas
This Pascal code contains a series of commands for finding nil-clean matrices of index 3 and 4 in M_n(F_2). The program is in Slovene and the algorithms are not the fastest possible, but using it one can see that there exist nil-clean elements of index 4 if n = 4 or n = 8. For n = 9 the program is too slow to solve the problem. It takes aprroximately 10 hours to handle the case n = 8.
## Nil-clean.cpp
This C++ code contains a program to find, for a fixed matrix A over F_2, an idempotent matrix E such that (A - E)^3 = 0, or to prove that such an idempotent does not exist. The program uses an improved algorithm and is extremely fast. Using it one can show that in the matrix ring M_n(F_2), every element is nil-clean of index (at most) 3 if n = 10 or n = 11, and there exist elements which are nil-clean of index 4 if n = 9. (It takes about 10 minutes to handle the case n = 11.) By a recent paper of Shitov [Shitov, The ring M_{8k+4}(Z_2) is nil-clean of index four, Indagationes Mathematicae, 2019], there exist nil-clean elements of index 4 if n = 12. Hence for n <= 12, M_n(F_2) is of index four exactly when n = 4, 8, 9, 12.
